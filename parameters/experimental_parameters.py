# A parameter file for various dimensions and variables to do with the experimental constraints, such as cut conditions, efficiencies etc.

pseudorapidity_minimum = 0   # Minimum pseudorapidity criteria for HNL decay 
pseudorapidity_maximum = 2.4 # Maximum pseudorapidity criteria for HNL decay

r_min = '120 mm' # Minimum distance from interaction point (IP) to consider HNL decays/decay volume
r_max = '300 mm' # Maximum distance from interaction point (IP) to consider HNL decays/decay volume
