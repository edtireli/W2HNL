# W2HNL
## Overview
This Python program is developed for the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to facilitate the search for displaced vertices, specifically focusing on heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) decaying into di-lepton pairs at macroscopic distances from the interaction point.

## Features

- **ATLAS Geometry Integration**: Accurately simulates the ATLAS detector geometry to identify potential displaced vertices.
- **HNL Decay Modeling**: Includes models for HNL decay into di-lepton pairs, considering various decay channels and lifetimes.
- **Event Reconstruction**: Efficiently reconstructs events from raw detector data, highlighting potential HNL decays.
- **Data Analysis Tools**: Provides tools for data filtering, analysis, and visualization to identify significant signals of HNL decay.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to adjust key parameters like HNL mass, coupling constants, and decay channels.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/AtlasHNLSearch.git
