# A parameter file for various dimensions and variables to do with the experimental constraints, such as cut conditions, efficiencies etc.

pseudorapidity_minimum = 0   # Minimum pseudorapidity criteria for HNL decay 
pseudorapidity_maximum = 2.4 # Maximum pseudorapidity criteria for HNL decay

r_min = '120 mm' # Minimum distance from interaction point (IP) to consider HNL decays/decay volume
r_max = '300 mm' # Maximum distance from interaction point (IP) to consider HNL decays/decay volume




pid_boson            = 24 # 24 = W boson
pid_prompt_lepton    = 15 # 11=e, 13 = muon, 15 = tau
pid_displaced_lepton = 13 # 11=e, 13 = muon, 15 = tau, here we assume a symmetric decay to lepton+ and lepton- of the same flavour
